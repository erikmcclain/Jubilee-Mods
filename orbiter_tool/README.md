# Carriage Assembly Mods.
Oribiter tool, version 1 I tried to mount like a hemera tool,  the mount is good but the cooling duct is not.  I abandoned it for mounting it like a BMG instead
	
	
Individual step and stl files are saved or will be in seperate folders, the whole fusion project is saved as orbiter_mount_with_dumbboard_V##
	
	
Notes:
I added a seperate folder for my version of the dock that uses springs I ordered them from Mcmastercarr
302 Stainless Steel Corrosion-Resistant Compression Springs
0.75" Long, 0.375" OD, 0.305" ID

A shorter spring about 0.5 inches should probably be able to work here, I dont happend to have them to test at the moment

I am using the original version of Luke Labs dumboards.  The back plate should work fine for the new version but the mount may need a tweak as the new version is a slightly differnt shape.
